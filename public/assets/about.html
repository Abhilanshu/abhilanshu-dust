            <span class="italic">Mouthful of Dust</span> – a line taken from Ned
            Kelly’s Jerilderie Letter – presents spatial photography of his
            armour, boot, rifle, death mask and the Letter, accompanied by new
            writing commissions from <strong>Grace Chan</strong>,
            <strong>Cameron Hurst</strong> of
            <span class="italic">The Paris End</span>,
            <strong>Wesley Enoch</strong>, <strong>Sarah Krasnostein</strong>,
            and <strong>Nam Le</strong>. Made from hundreds of still photographs
            of these 19th-century objects, the 3D models offer near-forensic
            detail and uncanny perspectives. Across a spectrum of literary
            genres, the writers describe what they observe in these images now
            floating in digital space, and what they imagine as they navigate
            around them. Their stories and speculations add new layers of
            interpretation and suggest different ways of knowing these historic
            objects.

            <strong>Edward ‘Ned’ Kelly</strong>, Australia’s most notorious
            bushranger, was born in 1854, the same year State Library Victoria
            was founded. His short life was a series of crises, some self-made
            but many imposed and his story remains intertwined with the Library
            through our collections. Ultimately hanged for murder, Kelly
            orchestrated daring campaigns of theft and destruction while
            claiming he was unjustly outlawed. His actions, as well as those of
            his pursuers, and the whole setting for his story, have been
            discussed for over a century.
          </p>
          <p>
            For many, including some of Australia’s best-known artists and
            writers, Kelly is seen as a person of independent thought, who
            experienced but also forcefully denounced racial and class
            persecution, and abuses of power. Novelist
            <strong>Peter Carey</strong> described Kelly as an avant-garde
            artist after reading his famous Jerilderie Letter, and he has
            inspired iconic phrases and images in our culture: the shape of an
            iron helmet with a horizontal slit belongs to no-one else. Carey’s
            award-winning novel <span class="italic"
              >True History of the Kelly Gang</span
            >
            &nbsp;argues, along with its epigraph by William Faulkner, that ‘The
            past is not dead. It is not even past.’ Kelly’s ongoing relevance as
            a figure of resistance is enlivened by this idea.
