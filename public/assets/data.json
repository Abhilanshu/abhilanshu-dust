      "detail": "This right-foot boot belonged to Ned Kelly and was worn during his gang’s last stand at Glenrowan. After Kelly was captured, a reporter at the scene cut the boot from his severely injured foot. The boot was then given to railway guard Jesse Dowsett in recognition of his role in the capture. Dowsett had aided two of the gang’s hostages in escaping from the Glenrowan Inn and, along with the police, disarmed Kelly of his revolver after he succumbed to wounds from twenty-eight bullets. Historian Ian Jones notes that while one policeman intended to shoot Kelly on the spot, it was Dowsett who protested he be taken into custody alive.",

Stitching is visible near the heel of the boot and the base of the shaft. A leather texture is present across the entire surface of the boot.",

      "credit": "MS13361<br/>Anonymous donation 2000",
      "detail": "Ned Kelly argued that racial and class prejudice underpinned his notoriety in a 56-page statement now known as the Jerilderie Letter. Kelly dictated the letter to gang member Joe Byrne and attempted to have it published. It describes his version of the events regarding the murder that ultimately led to his hanging. While asserting self-defence, Kelly also details the injustices endured by his family, impoverished Irish farmers, at the hands of both the police and the wealthy ‘squattocracy,’ who controlled prime farming land and parts of the government. The letter is full of ringing phrases but also expressions of violence. Public interest in Kelly’s account has risen steadily after it was published in full in the late 1940s.",

      "detail": "This mask is one of several taken from the cast officially made shortly after Ned Kelly was hanged at Melbourne Gaol on 11 November 1880, though only five are known to exist today. The casting was by Maximillan Ludwig Kreitmayer, an anatomical modeller and owner of a waxworks business in Melbourne. Kreitmayer catered to enthusiasts of the then-discredited pseudoscience of phrenology, which involved analysing character traits based on the shape of the human head. In the days following Kelly’s execution and decapitation, his death mask was put on public display at Kreitmayer’s. In the Herald A. S. Hamilton, a phrenologist and critic of capital punishment, suggested that the mask revealed Kelly’s ‘active hope, self-esteem, and firmness.’",
      "alt": "A 3D scanned model of the death mask of Ned Kelly. Kelly’s eyes appear shut and he has a neutral expression on his face. His head is slightly angled to his right. With the appearance and texture of plaster, the mask is a cast of Kelly’s entire head. The detail of eyebrows and eyelashes can be seen in the cast, otherwise Kelly appears bald. The base of the mask has a small hole in it.",

      "detail": "Right shoulder plate purchased by State Library Victoria with funds from the Sundberg Bequest and the Department of Communications, Information Technology and the Arts in 2001; Left shoulder plate on loan from Museums Victoria<br/><br/>Ned Kelly’s iron armour, though worn only once, is a defining aspect of his story and it was presented at his trial in court. Its origins, purpose, and unique design contribute to its iconic cultural significance. During their last stand with the police at Glenrowan, all four members of the Kelly gang—Ned, his brother Dan, and their friends Joe Byrne and Steve Hart—wore armour. In the year before the siege they began constructing the suits from the thick metal parts of ploughs; some were bought, others were offered by sympathetic farmers and a few were stolen. Under his armour Ned wore the green silk sash he received as a child for rescuing a boy from drowning.",
      "alt": "A 3D scanned model of Ned Kelly’s armour. It is comprised of separate pieces of head and body armour. The armour has a dark silver appearance with a layer of red rust throughout the piece. The helmet is mostly round with a thin horizontal slit for Kelly’s eyes, and bullet impact dents can be seen. The body armour are long curved sheets of metal, the inside of one plate has the words “D. K” and “D. KELLY” written in brushstroke, with the words “POLICE EXHIBITION” stamped on top in red stencil. Holes are present across the armour that would have been used to keep the armour together when being worn.",
